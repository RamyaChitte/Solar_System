# SOLAR SYSTEM
The study of the solar system for example, by using the visualization of objects in the solar system would facilitate teachers 
for the delivery of content. However, the problem is how to implement a visual method of learning about the 
Solar System. How to know the relative speeds of each planets which determines the time taken by the planets 
to complete one revolution around the Sun. How to determine the relative positions and distances of each planet 
from the Sun which influences the temperature on the planet.

It is an incredibly solar system tour, allowing you to explore the solar system, the night sky and the 
planets. All of the planets are accurately positioned based on where they are present in the Solar System, and 
the tour contains interesting facts and information about each planet in the solar system. Due to the rapid increase 
in the development of technology, education learning is now using technology in order to deliver more 
interesting and easily memorable contents. Thus, there is huge scope for teaching that includes visualization of 
objects.
# Objectives
The purpose of this project is as follows: 
To create and apply the visual method of learning about the Solar System. To show the shadow implementation using OPENGL. 
To show the movement, light, and texture properties of the planets. 
To implement the transformation operations like translation, rotation, scaling etc. on objects. 
To provide information about every planet through a user-friendly interface.
To display the planets in the increasing order of their sizes. 
To show the implementation of bitmap images into objects. 
To show the implementation of stars twinkling.
